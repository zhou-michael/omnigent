    Auto-create a Codex terminal for a codex-native session.

    Called when the runner receives a codex-native session via
    ``POST /v1/sessions`` or an explicit terminal ensure request and no
    terminal exists yet. Mirrors :func:`_auto_create_claude_terminal`: it
    boots a Codex app-server, registers the Codex TUI as a streamable
    terminal resource attached to that app-server, then runs the transcript
    forwarder so the chat and terminal share one thread.

    Fresh sessions launch without a thread id so the TUI owns thread
    creation; resume sessions launch with the persisted Codex thread id,
    falling back to a fresh thread when Codex cannot read that thread's
    rollout (see :func:`is_unreadable_thread_error`). The runner does not
    pre-create a thread, because ``codex resume`` of a thread with no
    rollout yet exits the TUI (leaving a dead pane).

    :param session_id: Session/conversation identifier, e.g.
        ``"conv_abc123"``.
    :param resource_registry: Session resource registry used to launch
        the Codex terminal resource.
    :param publish_event: The runner's per-session SSE emitter, used to
        surface the new terminal on the live stream (the Omnigent relay
        republishes it to the web UI) so the Terminal toggle enables
        without a refresh.
    :param bundle_dir: Materialized agent-bundle root when the session's
        agent ships a ``skills/`` directory, resolved by the caller
        (which has the runner's spec resolver). Its skills are linked
        into the per-bridge ``$CODEX_HOME/skills/`` before the
        app-server boots so the native Codex discovers them — matching
        the wrapped ``codex`` executor. ``None`` exposes no bundle skills.
    :param skills_filter: The agent spec's ``skills_filter`` (``"all"``
        / ``"none"`` / list of skill names), honoured when populating
        ``$CODEX_HOME/skills/``. Defaults to ``"all"``.
    :param agent_spec: Optional resolved agent spec for the session.
        When provided, its executor model is used as the Codex app-server
        default, e.g. ``"gpt-5.4-mini"``.
    :param server_client: Runner's Omnigent server HTTP client. Used to read
        persisted launch args and the native thread id.
    :returns: The created terminal resource view.

    Adopt the fresh Codex TUI's thread, then mirror it into the Omnigent session.

    Runs as a background task spawned by :func:`_auto_create_codex_terminal`
    so session creation never blocks on TUI startup. Waits for the fresh TUI
    to create its app-server thread, persists the bridge state (so the Codex
    executor's bridge-state retry can inject web-UI turns into that same
    thread), then runs the transcript forwarder for the session's lifetime.

    :param session_id: Omnigent session/conversation id, e.g. ``"conv_abc123"``.
    :param bridge_dir: Native Codex bridge directory for this session.
    :param codex_ws_url: App-server loopback ws URL the TUI and forwarder
        attach to, e.g. ``"ws://127.0.0.1:9876"``. Persisted as the bridge
        state's ``socket_path`` (the executor reads it to reach the
        app-server) and re-persisted by the forwarder's thread-rotation
        path so a native ``/clear`` keeps the ws:// transport.
    :param codex_home: Per-session private ``CODEX_HOME`` path.
    :param workspace: The session workspace directory, persisted as the
        bridge state's ``cwd`` so web-driven turns run shell tools there
        instead of the runner process's working directory.
    :param event_client: Connected app-server listener that will observe the
        TUI's ``thread/started``; reused to subscribe the forwarder.
    :param routing_summary: One-line description of the resolved launch
        routing (provider / profile / model, or the login-fallback state),
        threaded into the startup-timeout error so hosted users can diagnose
        without runner-log access (see #2745).
    :param login_required: ``True`` when the resolved launch defers to
        Codex's own login with no usable stored credential — the TUI parks
        on the sign-in screen and cannot start a thread on its own. Chat
        turns then fail fast with an actionable error (instead of burning
        the thread-start timeout), while thread discovery keeps listening
        so an interactive sign-in from the terminal still recovers the
        session.
    :param subagent_router: Router this terminal launch started, torn down
        in the ``finally``. Passed so a late teardown cannot close the
        endpoint a re-created terminal has since installed.
    :param turn_router: First-message routing endpoint this launch
        started, torn down alongside the subagent one.

    Auto-create the native Antigravity (agy) terminal for a session.

    Called when the runner receives an antigravity-native session via
    ``POST /v1/sessions`` or an explicit terminal-ensure request and no
    terminal exists yet — the host-spawned (web-UI) case where no CLI
    client is present to launch the terminal itself.

    Unlike codex-native there is **no app-server**: agy self-hosts its
    control surface, so this boots agy directly in a runner-owned tmux
    terminal and runs the native RPC streaming reader server-side so the
    web chat view mirrors agy's conversation. It is structurally closer to
    :func:`_auto_create_claude_terminal` (the terminal IS the agent
    process and the reader is the single conversation writer) than to the
    codex path. The terminal starts agy immediately
    (``tmux_start_on_attach=False``) — UNLIKE the CLI launch in
    :func:`omnigent.harnesses.antigravity_native.main._launch_antigravity_terminal`, which
    keeps ``start_on_attach=True`` for its human-TTY driver: this host-spawned
    path has no TTY, and the executor must be able to drive agy's first turn
    over tmux whether or not a web client has opened the Terminal panel (see
    the ``tmux_start_on_attach`` note on the spec below).

    **Permissions are web-attended, not headless.** The web client attaches
    to the agy pane through the runner tunnel and answers agy's
    ``request-review`` TUI prompt there, so the launch is treated as
    *attended* (``headless=False``). Auto-bypass comes only from the user's
    persisted ``terminal_launch_args`` (which carry
    ``--dangerously-skip-permissions`` when the user asked for bypass) —
    the same pass-through mechanism codex/claude use. A server-spawned
    launch must NOT key headlessness on the runner process's (absent) TTY,
    which would silently disable the per-tool prompt for a watching web
    user.

    Fresh sessions launch with no ``--conversation``: the runner cold-starts
    the conversation over connect-RPC (11a) so the reader binds agy's real id
    directly. Resume sessions launch ``--conversation <external_session_id>``
    (agy's real id, persisted by a prior run).

    :param session_id: Session/conversation identifier, e.g.
        ``"conv_abc123"``.
    :param resource_registry: Session resource registry used to launch the
        agy terminal resource.
    :param publish_event: The runner's per-session SSE emitter, used to
        surface the new terminal on the live stream so the web UI's Terminal
        toggle enables without a refresh.
    :param server_client: Runner's Omnigent server HTTP client. Used to read
        the persisted workspace, launch args, and the discovered agy
        conversation id (``external_session_id``) for resume.
    :param ensure_comment_relay: The runner's relay starter
        (``_ensure_comment_relay_started``). When provided, the Omnigent MCP
        relay is started against this session's bridge dir before launch so the
        wrapped agy sees the ``sys_*`` tools (#1194). ``None`` skips relay wiring

    Cold-start agy's conversation over connect-RPC and own its id (best-effort).

    The fresh-launch bootstrap: the runner mints the conversation over
    ``StartCascade`` so the executor's turn-1 has a real cascade id, instead of
    waiting for the agy TUI to lazily create one on its first typed turn. The
    connect-RPC port is resolved by
    :func:`omnigent.harnesses.antigravity_native.rpc.resolve_cold_start_agy_rpc_port`:
    scoped to THIS session's own agy via its tmux pane (``tmux_socket`` /
    ``tmux_target``) so a host running several agy instances (sub-agent fan-out /
    shared runner) cannot ``StartCascade`` onto a FOREIGN agy and permanently
    cross-bind the session — the conversation-ownership check that normally
    disambiguates is not usable yet (no conversation exists). It falls back to the
    lowest ``Heartbeat``-answering candidate (current behavior) only when no local
    pane is reachable (remote runner), or once our agy is up in the pane but its
    port is not lsof-attributable; while our agy is NOT yet up in the pane it keeps
    polling rather than risk a foreign-agy candidate. This polls that resolver
    until a port binds and ``GetAvailableModels`` returns a non-empty catalog,
    allows agy post-login initialization to settle, then ``StartCascade``s a
    runner-generated
    ``uuid4`` and writes THAT real id into bridge state (replacing the
    ``agy_conv_*`` placeholder) so :func:`read_bridge_state` returns the real id
    and the reader/executor address the cold-started conversation directly.

    The cold-started id is also PATCHed onto the Omnigent session as
    ``external_session_id`` (best-effort, mirroring codex/pi) so a later
    ``--resume`` reads it back and passes ``--conversation <id>`` to continue
    agy's actual conversation — the read-path replacement for the forwarder's
    ``_patch_external_session_id``. Only the fresh-launch caller invokes this
    (``if not resume:``); a resume already holds agy's real id, so it neither
    cold-starts nor re-PATCHes. As defense-in-depth (mirroring the CLI cold-start),
    this ALSO early-returns the existing id when bridge state already holds a
    non-placeholder conversation id, so it can never cold-start over a real id even
    if a future caller forgets the resume gate.

    **Best-effort, never raises.** A bootstrap failure (no port within
    *timeout_s*, no ready model catalog within *timeout_s*, or ``StartCascade``
    erroring) must NOT abort the auto-create:
    that would leave a registered terminal with no reader (which a later
    ensure sees and returns 200 for, never self-healing). On failure this logs
    and returns ``None`` (the placeholder stays; the reader's discovery then binds
    agy's real id once a turn creates the conversation). The sync
    RPC/poll work runs in :func:`asyncio.to_thread` so the event loop is never
    blocked.

    :param bridge_dir: Native Antigravity bridge directory whose ``state.json``
        the real cold-started id is written into.

        the ``external_session_id`` PATCH target).
    :param server_client: Runner Omnigent server client used for the
        ``external_session_id`` PATCH. ``None`` skips the PATCH (the cascade id is

        ``StartCascade`` port to the agy running under this session's pane.
        ``None`` (remote runner / no local pane) falls back to the candidate scan.
    :param tmux_target: This session's tmux target (e.g. ``"main"``), paired with
        ``tmux_socket`` for the pane-scoped port resolution.
    :param timeout_s: Total seconds to wait for agy's connect-RPC port and model

    Auto-create an Omnigent REPL terminal for a runner-hosted SDK session.

    Called when the runner receives a non-native (SDK-harness) top-level
    session via ``POST /v1/sessions`` and no REPL terminal exists yet. The
    terminal hosts the framework's own TUI (``omnigent attach
    <session_id> --server <url>``) in a tmux pane, exposed through the
    standard terminal-attach WebSocket so the web UI embeds it exactly
    like the claude-/codex-native terminals — with the Omnigent REPL as
    the TUI.

    The REPL is a pure co-drive client: it joins the live session over
    HTTP+SSE and dispatches turns to this runner, so the web chat view and
    the embedded terminal stay in sync. The tmux command is deferred until
    the first client attaches (``tmux_start_on_attach``): a session whose
    terminal is never opened pays only for an idle tmux pane, and by first
    attach the session is fully live (``omnigent attach`` fails loud on a
    non-live session) with the REPL sized to the real attached terminal.

    Auth parity with the native terminals: the spawned ``omnigent
    attach`` resolves credentials for ``--server`` the same way a
    user-launched CLI does (``OMNIGENT_REMOTE_AUTH_TOKEN`` env → stored
    OIDC token from ``omnigent login`` → ``~/.databrickscfg``), which
    holds because the runner lives on the user's machine.

    :param session_id: Session/conversation identifier,
        e.g. ``"conv_abc123"``.
    :param resource_registry: Session resource registry for launching the
        terminal.

        ``(session_id, event_dict) -> None``, used to surface the new
        terminal on the live stream so the web UI's Terminal pill enables
        without a refresh.
    :param server_client: Omnigent server client used to stamp the
        ``omnigent.ui: terminal`` presentation label that makes the web
