"""RPC read driver for a native Antigravity (agy) session.

This is the read-path driver that replaced the retired transcript-tail forwarder
(``omnigent.antigravity_native_forwarder``, deleted in the Task 12 cutover).
Instead of tailing agy's plaintext JSONL transcript, it polls agy's connect-RPC
``GetCascadeTrajectorySteps`` surface for trajectory steps, maps each new step to
Omnigent conversation items, POSTs them, emits ``external_session_status`` edges
on turn transitions, and hands ``WAITING`` steps (questions / permission asks) to
the Task 8 interaction bridge through an injected callback.

How it differs from the transcript forwarder it supersedes:

* **Read transport is the RPC, not the file.** Steps come from
  :func:`omnigent.harnesses.antigravity_native.rpc.get_trajectory_steps` rather than a byte
  tail. The RPC returns the *full* trajectory step list on every call (a
  snapshot), so the driver de-dups *within the run* by ``(trajectory_id,
  step_index)`` identity and posts only steps it has not yet seen.

* **No durable cursor.** The transcript forwarder persisted a ``forwarded_steps``
  resume cursor to bridge state so a restart did not re-mirror the whole file.
  This driver keeps an *in-memory* seen-set only; the durable cursor (and its
  JSONL) is retired in the Task 12 cutover. A restart re-reads from the start —
  acceptable because the reader is recreated per session by the Task 11 runner,
  not crash-restarted mid-conversation, and the mapper's USER_INPUT-skip plus the
  server's own item handling bound the blast radius.

* **The mapper carries the item logic.** :func:`map_step_to_events` is the pure,
  no-delta, skip-USER_INPUT mapping layer (Task 4). It deliberately does NOT emit
  status edges — that was always the stateful parser's job. This driver is now
  that stateful layer: it replicates the transcript parser's RUNNING/IDLE
  transition emission (a turn opens on a USER_INPUT step and closes on an
  assistant-text PLANNER_RESPONSE that issues no tool calls), deduped so an edge
  fires only on a real transition.

Discovery mirrors the forwarder's discipline — *poll until ready, never guess*:

1. **Cascade id.** agy mints its own conversation UUID (it ignores the launcher's
   ``ANTIGRAVITY_CONVERSATION_ID``) and the launcher seeds bridge state with an
   ``agy_conv_*`` placeholder until the real id is discovered and persisted. The
   reader polls :func:`read_bridge_state` until ``conversation_id`` is present and
   is NOT a placeholder; that real id is the cascade id (agy uses one UUID for
   both the conversation and the cascade).
2. **RPC port.** The reader enumerates candidate agy connect-RPC ports
   (:func:`_candidate_agy_rpc_ports`) and binds the one that confirms it hosts the
   cascade id (:func:`_conversation_matches`). It keeps polling until a port
   confirms ownership — a recycled/foreign port is rejected, never written to.

Everything that touches the network (the RPC client) or the clock (sleeps) is
funnelled through module-level seams so the unit tests drive the loop with a
scripted step source and a captured post sink, no real agy and no real sockets.
The loop is finite under test via an injectable ``stop`` predicate.

      (:func:`_summary_activity`: ``lastUserInputTime`` preferred, else
      ``lastModifiedTime``). An entry with NO parseable activity (a bare ``/clear``
      mint, both timestamps ``null``) is not a candidate.

      The bound entry's activity is looked up from ``summaries`` itself; if the
      bound entry is absent (we cannot prove the bound conversation is staler), we
      do NOT rotate — returning ``None`` keeps the reader on its current binding

    Poll ``GetAllCascadeTrajectories`` for a ``/clear`` rotation, then signal once.

    The Task T-G rotation DETECTOR, run as a background task alongside the
    stream/poll reader body (which is bound to one cascade and so cannot itself
    observe a sibling conversation). Every ``interval_s`` it fetches the cascade
    summaries and asks :func:`_detect_rotated_cascade` whether a newer-active root
    cascade exists; the FIRST time one does, it invokes ``on_rotation`` with the
    new cascade id and returns (one rotation per detector — the caller tears the
    reader body down, rotates the session, and starts a fresh detector on rebind).

    ``skip_cascade_ids`` are cascades a PRIOR rotation attempt already failed to
    bind (e.g. the Omnigent session-create errored); ignoring them here is what
    prevents a hot re-detect/re-fail loop when rotation cannot complete — the
    reader then keeps serving the old binding without this detector flapping.

    Termination is by CANCELLATION only (``supervise_reader``'s ``finally`` always
    cancels this task): the detector deliberately does NOT consult the reader's
    ``stop`` predicate, so it never races the bounded body loop's shared
    iteration counter under test. Best-effort: a fetch failure
    (``httpx.HTTPError`` / ``ValueError``) is logged and skipped (the next tick
    retries) so a transient agy fault never kills the detector. A benign
    ``httpx.ConnectError`` (connection refused — the port is already gone during
    teardown/rotation/shutdown before this task is cancelled) is logged at DEBUG
    rather than WARNING to avoid spamming the log every tick; every other
    ``httpx.HTTPError`` (e.g. a hung-but-listening port raising ``ReadTimeout``)

      transition (deduped via an in-memory turn-active flag);
    * when the step is ``WAITING`` for user interaction, invokes
      ``on_pending_interaction`` exactly once for that interaction (the Task 8
      bridge drives the elicitation + answer).

    De-dup is by ``(trajectory_id, step_index)`` identity in an in-memory
    seen-set (no durable cursor — retired in Task 12), so re-reading the same
    snapshot posts nothing. Tool-call ids are derived from each step's own
    ``(trajectory, step)`` identity by the mapper, so a re-read or a fallback to
    a different RPC re-derives the same id rather than re-keying the pair.

    Error handling: an RPC failure on a poll — ``httpx.HTTPError`` (transport AND
    non-2xx both raise it) or a ``ValueError`` (a non-JSON 200 body) — is logged
    and swallowed so a transient fault never kills the loop; the next poll
    recovers.

    Task T-G ``/clear`` rotation: the stream/poll reader body runs as a CANCELLABLE
    task and, ALONGSIDE it, a :func:`_watch_for_rotation` background task polls
    ``GetAllCascadeTrajectories`` every ``detect_rotation_interval_s`` (the stream
    is bound to one cascade and cannot see a sibling). When it detects a
    newer-active root cascade (a TUI ``/clear`` mints one) it records the new id and
    CANCELS the body task — necessary because after a ``/clear`` the bound cascade
    goes idle and the stream blocks inside a deadline-less ``aiter_bytes`` read,
    where the cooperative ``stop`` checkpoint is never reached; cancellation
    interrupts that wedged read. This function then RETURNS the new cascade id so
    :func:`run_reader_with_bridge` can rotate the Omnigent session and rebind. When
    the body ends on its own (the ``stop`` predicate fired, or the stream+poll both
    exited) it returns ``None``; an EXTERNAL cancellation of this coroutine (no
    rotation recorded) propagates rather than being mistaken for a rotation.

    :param bridge_dir: Native Antigravity bridge directory (identifies the
        session whose agy conversation to mirror).
    :param session_id: Omnigent conversation id to mirror into, e.g.
        ``"conv_abc123"``.
    :param client: HTTP client for Omnigent event posts.
    :param on_pending_interaction: Async callback handed each distinct WAITING
        interaction (the Task 8 interaction bridge), as
        ``(cascade_id, port, pending)`` — the SAME cascade id + connect-RPC port
        the reader discovered, so the bridge targets agy's live conversation
        without re-discovering. Invoked at most once per
        ``(trajectory_id, step_index)``.
    :param poll_interval_s: Seconds between RPC polls (and discovery polls).
    :param stop: Optional predicate consulted once per loop iteration; when it
        returns ``True`` the loop exits. ``None`` (production) loops until the
        task is cancelled. Provided so tests drive a bounded number of

    :param detect_rotation_interval_s: Seconds between ``/clear``-rotation checks
        (kept coarse so the loopback RPC is not hammered).
    :param skip_cascade_ids: Cascade ids a prior rotation attempt failed to bind;

        detect/rotate-fail loop — the reader keeps the old binding instead).

    """
    Per-run trackers shared across the stream loop and the poll fallback.

    Kept in one object so a fall-through from a partially consumed stream to the
    poll loop reuses the same de-dup/turn/interaction state — a step already
    mirrored over the stream is not re-posted by the poll loop, and an open turn
    is not re-opened.

    :param seen: :func:`_step_key` identities whose COMMITTED items have been
        posted, so the on-connect snapshot replay (and steady-state re-reads)
        post nothing.
    :param interacted: Identities whose WAITING interaction was already handed to
        the bridge, so a re-sent WAITING frame does not re-fire it.
    :param prefixes: Per-PLANNER ``step_index`` → the ``modifiedResponse`` text
        actually SENT as deltas so far, so each frame emits only the NEW suffix.
        Advanced only when a delta goes out: it mirrors the server's buffer, and
        anchoring it to text that was never sent would cut the next delta from
        the wrong offset. Cleared for a step when its committed ``message`` is
        posted (stream path only; the poll path never populates it).
    :param delta_chunks: Per-PLANNER ``step_index`` → how many text deltas have
        been emitted for it, which is the delta ``index`` the server orders on.
        A counter rather than the forwarded byte offset because agy can replace
        a partial with a SHORTER post-moderation rewrite: the offset would then
        move backwards and the server would drop the closing ``final`` chunk,
        leaving the message in flight to be replayed. Cleared with ``prefixes``.
    :param reasoning_prefixes: Per-PLANNER ``step_index`` → the ``thinking`` text
        already forwarded as reasoning deltas, mirroring ``prefixes`` for the
        reasoning stream (design §10.2). A step's first entry doubles as the
        "reasoning started" marker: absent ⇒ the next reasoning delta is the
        step's first (carries ``started=True``). Cleared with ``prefixes`` when the
        committed ``message`` is posted (stream path only).
    :param turn_active: Whether a turn is currently considered open (a RUNNING
        edge fired and no closing IDLE edge yet).
    :param posted_model_enum: The last model enum already mirrored via
        ``external_model_change``. ``None`` = none posted yet.  Tracks the raw
        enum (NOT the displayName) so de-dup comparison is enum-stable.
    :param model_catalog: Cached result of ``GetAvailableModels`` for this
        reader run (fetched once on first model-change detection; ``None``
        until needed).
    :param port: Validated connect-RPC port used for lazy catalog fetch.
    :param cumulative_input_tokens: Running session total of input tokens
        accumulated across all PLANNER_RESPONSE DONE steps this run. The server
        treats ``external_session_usage.cumulative_input_tokens`` as a SET
        (new value = current total), so we must sum, not emit per-call values.
        Reset to 0 at the start of each reader run; a T-G /clear rotation rebinds
        with a FRESH ``_ReaderState`` (``supervise_reader`` is re-entered), so the
        new conversation's cost badge starts from 0 automatically.
    :param cumulative_output_tokens: Running session total of output tokens.
    :param cumulative_cache_read_input_tokens: Running session total of
        cache-read input tokens.
    :param interaction_task: The single in-flight interaction-bridge task, or
        ``None`` when none is running. The bridge runs OFF the reader loop so
        streaming/mirroring continues while a human answers (a long-poll can last
        a day); at most one runs at a time because the in-flight bridge owns agy's
        WAITING-timeout retries (a second would double-fire). Cancelled on reader
        teardown.
    :param surfaced_elicitations: ``_StepKey`` → the deterministic elicitation id
        published for that WAITING step. Populated when an interaction is handed to
        the bridge; consumed by :func:`_maybe_withdraw_interaction` when the step
        is later seen NO LONGER WAITING (answered in the agy TUI, or agy timed
        out) to WITHDRAW the still-parked web card (#1200, direction 2). An entry
        is removed once withdrawn so the withdraw posts at most once.
    :param interaction_rescans: In-flight re-scan tasks scheduled by a bridge's
        done-callback to surface a WAITING gate deferred while the bridge ran.
        Held as strong refs so they are not GC'd mid-run; cancelled on teardown.
    :param subagent_mirrors: agy child cascade id → the task mirroring that
        cascade into its own Omnigent child session. One per sub-agent, started
        when the parent's ``INVOKE_SUBAGENT`` step first names the child and
        held as a strong ref so it is not GC'd mid-run; cancelled on teardown.
        Doubles as the start-once guard — a re-sent step re-enters the handler
        every frame while the sub-agents work.

      suffix of ``plannerResponse.modifiedResponse`` past the per-``step_index``
      forwarded prefix and, when non-empty, emit one incremental
      ``external_output_text_delta`` (stable per-step ``message_id``,
      ``final=False``). The prefix tracker advances so the next frame emits only
      the next suffix — deltas never overlap or duplicate.
    * Any step reaching a committed state (DONE / non-planner result) → emit its
      committed items via :func:`map_step_to_events`, deduped by
      ``(trajectory_id, step_index)`` so the on-connect snapshot replay and the
      cumulative re-sends do not double-post. For the planner step this is the
      committed ``message`` (its deltas already preceded it, satisfying the
      flush-barrier reconciliation contract); its prefix tracker is then cleared.
    * A WAITING step → handed to the bridge exactly once.

    The stream is consumed and then RE-ENTERED while ``stop`` stays falsy (a real
    connect stream returns when the turn settles, so re-entry resumes live updates
    for the next turn). ``stop`` is consulted once per re-entry, mirroring the
    poll loop, and a small :data:`_STREAM_REENTRY_BACKOFF_S` sleep separates
    re-entries so an immediate clean trailer cannot busy-spin re-POSTing the
    stream at zero delay (the steady-state stream blocks awaiting frames, so the
    delay is paid only once per turn-settle). A transport ``httpx.HTTPError`` or a
    connect-trailer ``AntigravityRpcError`` propagates to the caller, which falls
    back to the poll loop.

    same status edges. Its ``_ReaderState`` is private to the child so its
    de-dup and turn flag cannot collide with the parent's.

    **The parent's step is not the finish signal.** ``invoke_subagent`` is

    the child runs on for minutes afterwards (live-verified — a child kept
    working 23s past its spawning step's ``completedAt``, and accumulated 35
    steps). Stopping on it mirrored only the child's opening prompt and left the
    rail spinning forever, so the child's OWN turn decides:

    * the turn opened and then closed — the ordinary path, and the close is what
      posts the child's IDLE edge;
    * the turn is open but the child has gone quiet for

    Withdraw a surfaced elicitation whose WAITING step left WAITING (#1200, dir 2).

    The inverse of :func:`_maybe_handle_interaction`. The reader publishes an
    elicitation when it first sees a WAITING permission/ask_question step; but a
    step can stop being WAITING without the WEB card being answered — the user
    types the answer directly in the agy TUI pane, or agy times out / auto-resolves
    the interaction. Without this, the parked web card LINGERS forever, showing
    "Respond to the pending request above to continue" while the agent has already
    moved on.

    So: when a step the reader previously surfaced is, on a later poll/frame, NO
    LONGER WAITING, POST ``external_elicitation_resolved`` for its elicitation id.
    Server-side this sets the parked future's ``resolved_elsewhere`` flag, which
    (a) clears the web card, and (b) makes any in-flight ``request_elicitation``
    long-poll return ``None`` — so a racing :func:`bridge_interaction` does NOT
    then deliver a stale verdict (the await short-circuits cleanly). Mirrors
    cursor-native's ``_post_external_elicitation_resolved``.

    Idempotency / no double-resolve: the entry is popped from
    ``surfaced_elicitations`` so the withdraw posts AT MOST ONCE per step. This is
    safe even when the step left WAITING because the WEB verdict resolved it (the
    bridge delivered): the server already consumed that parked future, so the
    withdraw finds none and merely tombstones the id (harmless) — it can never
    re-deliver, because the bridge's ``request_elicitation`` already returned the

# ── Task T-G: /clear-rotation session rotation ───────────────────────────────
#
# A TUI ``/clear`` mints a NEW agy root cascade ON THE SAME live agy process and
# leaves the bound one idle. The reader detects it via ``GetAllCascadeTrajectories``
# (see :func:`_detect_rotated_cascade`) and then must move Omnigent ownership onto a
# fresh conversation bound to the NEW cascade — otherwise web turns keep targeting
# the old (now-dead) conversation and streaming appears to end. This mirrors the
# claude forwarder's ``_create_clear_replacement_session`` session-rotation
# sequence: agy, like claude, is a SINGLE long-lived process hosting many cascades,
# so the rotation TRANSFERS the existing terminal onto the replacement session
# (it does NOT re-spawn agy) and inherits the OLD session's bridge-id label (so the
# replacement resolves to the SAME ``bridge_dir`` the reader is already using — agy's
# bridge_dir is keyed off the launcher's bridge-id, not the session id), then
# rewrites bridge state with the new conversation id so the reader rebinds.
#
# THE LOOP BUG this fixes (found by live e2e): the prior implementation also PATCHed
# the replacement session's ``external_session_id=new_cascade``. But POST
# /v1/sessions for an antigravity-native session makes the runner auto-cold-start a
# brand-new agy (``_auto_create_antigravity_terminal`` fired for EVERY such session),
# which minted its OWN cascade AND set the new session's external_session_id; the
# rotation's external_session_id PATCH then hit that already-set, set-once-immutable
# field → 400 → rotation aborted, but the cold-start had already rebound the reader
# to its fresh cascade → the detector re-fired → an infinite session-spawn loop. The
# fix: drop the external_session_id PATCH entirely (claude never does it) AND gate
# the runner's antigravity auto-create on an inbound-transfer check (mirroring
# claude's ``_terminal_inbound`` guard) so the cold-start is skipped for a rotation
# target and the existing agy is transferred instead.

# Deterministic agy terminal resource id (matches
# ``antigravity_native._TERMINAL_NAME`` / ``_TERMINAL_SESSION_KEY``). Single
# terminal per agy session ("main"), transferred old→new on rotation so the live
# tmux pane keeps running under the new conversation. Built from the lightweight
# ``session_resources`` helper (as the codex forwarder does) rather than importing
# the heavy ``antigravity_native`` runner module into the reader.

    Create + activate a replacement Omnigent session bound to a new agy cascade.

    The Task T-G rotation effect: after a TUI ``/clear`` mints ``new_cascade_id`` on
    the SAME live agy process, this moves Omnigent ownership onto a fresh
    conversation bound to that cascade, MIRRORING claude's
    ``_create_clear_replacement_session`` (verified against
    ``omnigent/claude_native_forwarder.py``). agy — like claude — is ONE long-lived
    process hosting multiple cascades; a ``/clear`` mints a new cascade on that same
    process, so the rotation TRANSFERS the existing terminal onto the new session
    (it does NOT re-spawn agy) and rewrites bridge state so the reader rebinds to the
    new cascade on the SAME process:

    1. GET the old session snapshot (``agent_id`` / ``runner_id`` / ``labels``).
    2. POST ``/v1/sessions`` with the old ``agent_id`` + inherited ``labels`` — the
       labels carry agy's bridge-id (:data:`ANTIGRAVITY_NATIVE_BRIDGE_ID_LABEL_KEY`),
       so the NEW session resolves to the SAME ``bridge_dir`` the reader uses (agy's
       bridge_dir is keyed off the launcher's bridge-id, NOT the session id — so we
       inherit the old label, exactly as claude carries its ``BRIDGE_ID_LABEL_KEY``).
    3. PATCH the new session's ``runner_id`` to the old runner (so the same runner
       owns it), when the old session had one.
    4. POST the terminal ``/transfer`` to move the live agy tmux pane old→new (the
       pane — the SAME agy process — keeps running under the new conversation).
       NO ``external_session_id`` PATCH is made: unlike a resume launch, the new
       cascade ``new_cascade_id`` is ALREADY live on the existing agy and reached via
       the rewritten bridge state below, not via a later ``--resume``. (The old code
       PATCHed it, which 400'd on the auto-cold-started session's already-set,
       set-once-immutable field and looped the rotation — see the module header.)
    5. Rewrite agy bridge state in ``bridge_dir`` with the new session id + new
       conversation id (the reader re-reads this on rebind to bind the new cascade).
    6. PATCH the old session's ``runner_id`` to ``""`` to release it (best-effort;
       a failure is logged, not raised — the new session is already live).

    Best-effort: ANY failure (snapshot, create, bind, transfer, state write) is
    logged at WARNING and yields ``None``, and the caller keeps serving the OLD
    binding rather than crashing or losing the reader. The bridge-state rewrite is
    performed only AFTER the new session is created and bound, so a mid-sequence
    failure never leaves bridge state pointing at a session that does not exist —
    and, mirroring claude, it lands AFTER the transfer so the runner's auto-create
    guard still sees the OLD session owning the terminal while the new session binds
    (see :func:`omnigent.runner.app._antigravity_native_terminal_arrives_via_transfer`).

    Run the agy RPC streaming reader + interaction bridge for one session.

    reader takes a client but does NOT own its lifecycle) and runs
    :func:`supervise_reader`, wiring its ``on_pending_interaction`` callback to the
    Task 8 interaction bridge:

    * ``request_elicitation`` → :func:`_request_agy_elicitation` (POSTs the Task 9
      ``antigravity-elicitation-request`` hook and long-poll-awaits the human),
      mirroring codex's ``_handle_codex_elicitation_request``;
    * ``get_steps`` → ``get_trajectory_steps(port, cascade_id)`` offloaded to a
      worker thread (the RPC is synchronous);
    * ``deliver`` → the bridge default (``handle_user_interaction`` in a thread).

    The reader discovers the cascade id + connect-RPC port and hands BOTH to the
    callback, so the bridge targets agy's live conversation without
    re-discovering (which could bind a recycled/foreign port).

    Task T-G ``/clear`` rotation: this LOOPS. :func:`supervise_reader` returns the
    new cascade id when it detects a TUI ``/clear`` (via
    :func:`_watch_for_rotation`); this then rotates the Omnigent session onto a
    fresh conversation bound to the new cascade (:func:`_rotate_session_for_cascade`,
    which rewrites bridge state in ``bridge_dir``) and re-enters
    :func:`supervise_reader` — which rediscovers the new cascade from the same
    ``bridge_dir`` with a fresh :class:`_ReaderState`. If the session rotation
    FAILS, the old binding is kept (the failed cascade is added to ``skip``) so the
    reader keeps serving rather than being lost; if rotation succeeds, ``session_id``
    advances so the interaction-bridge elicitation hook targets the new session.
    The loop ends only when ``supervise_reader`` returns ``None`` (the reader was
    cancelled / its bounded ``stop`` fired).

    :param headers: Auth headers for the Omnigent client (best-effort static

    :param auth: Refresh-capable httpx auth flow, or ``None`` when unauthenticated
        (the local-server runner path and the CLI attach fallback, which have no
        token to refresh — the bearer in ``headers``, if any, is used as-is).
