# ── Omnigent MCP relay wiring (sys_* tools) ──────────────────────────────────
#
# agy is otherwise tool-isolated from Omnigent: unlike claude/codex/cursor it
# wires no MCP relay, so the wrapped agy cannot reach any ``sys_*`` tool (spawn
# sub-agent sessions, drive Omnigent terminals, list agents/models, ``sys_os_*``).
# This section wires the SAME relay cursor #742 uses — the shared
# ``omnigent.harnesses.claude_native.bridge serve-mcp`` stdio server — into agy.
#
# THE CONFIG-SCOPING FOOTGUN. agy has no ``--mcp-config`` flag and ignores every
# ``ANTIGRAVITY_*`` env knob; it loads MCP servers from a single HOME-GLOBAL file,
# ``$HOME/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`` — the *same* file the user's
# interactive agy reads (verified empirically against agy 1.0.12). Writing that
# file directly would (a) clobber/pollute the user's interactive agy config and
# (b) be incorrect under concurrency: the relay command is bridge-dir-specific, so
# two antigravity-native sessions (or a session + the user's interactive agy)
# would fight over the one global file.
#
# CHOSEN DESIGN — per-session ISOLATED GEMINI DIR. The runner keeps agy's real
# ``HOME`` intact (needed for platform auth such as macOS keyring-backed tokens)
# and launches agy with its hidden ``--gemini_dir=<bridge_dir>/agy-home/.gemini``
# flag. That isolated Gemini dir is seeded with onboarding/migration markers and
# a bridge-scoped ``config/mcp_config.json`` written by :func:`write_mcp_config`.
# This (1) NEVER touches the user's real ``~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`` and
# (2) gives each session its own config so concurrent sessions never clobber one
# another. Known file-based OAuth markers are copied best-effort for platforms
# whose agy auth provider uses them, but HOME is deliberately not relocated.
#
# WHY NOT RELOCATE HOME (#1477). An earlier isolation design pointed ``HOME`` at
# the per-session tree. That broke auth on macOS: agy stores its OAuth token in
# the OS keyring (verified against agy 1.0.12 — the binary's auth path is
# ``keyring`` / "load token from keyring", NOT a ``~/.gemini`` file), and the
# keyring item is bound to the real login HOME, so any relocated HOME stalled
# every turn at the interactive OAuth prompt. The alternative of dropping HOME
# isolation entirely on macOS (#1493) restored auth but reintroduced the
# HOME-global ``mcp_config.json`` footgun (#1194) there — concurrent sessions
# would clobber one another's relay config. ``--gemini_dir`` resolves both at
# once: real HOME ⇒ keyring auth works on every platform; isolated gemini dir ⇒
# per-session MCP config. Verified live (agy 1.0.12): ``agy --gemini_dir=<dir>``
# materializes its ``antigravity-cli`` + ``config`` state under ``<dir>`` while

# mid-turn, and on a fresh session it also creates the conversation + brain dir
# the forwarder then discovers). This mirrors the cursor/claude native send-keys
# delivery; no shared tmux helper exists, so the small primitives are duplicated
# per the established per-harness convention.
