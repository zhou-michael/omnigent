"""Detect Google Antigravity (``agy``) credentials for ``antigravity-native``.

The ``agy`` CLI authenticates via a browser OAuth flow on first interactive run
— it has no ``agy login`` / ``agy auth status`` subcommand. *Where* and *how* it
persists the resulting token is **platform-specific**:

As of agy 1.1.13, it can instead use a non-empty ambient ``GEMINI_API_KEY``
with ``modelProvider: "gemini"`` in its settings.

- macOS through agy 1.0.10 writes ``~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json`` — a flat
  OAuth2 object (verified live against agy 1.0.10)::

      {"access_token": "ya29.…", "refresh_token": "1//0g…",
       "expiry_date": …, "id_token": "eyJ…", "scope": "…", "token_type": "Bearer"}

- Linux writes ``~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/antigravity-oauth-token`` — the OAuth
  object **nested under** ``token`` (verified live against agy 1.0.10)::

      {"auth_method": "oauth",
       "token": {"access_token": "ya29.…", "refresh_token": "1//0g…",
                 "token_type": "Bearer", "expiry": "…"}}

- macOS on agy 1.1.7+ writes **no token file at all** — the OAuth credential
  goes into the **Keychain**. A signed-in Mac therefore has neither file above,
  and a file-only check locks the user out of a harness they can actually run.

Detection is file-first with a CLI fallback. A non-empty ``access_token`` /
``refresh_token`` string — flat (macOS) or nested under ``token`` (Linux) —
counts as a completed login. When no file carries one, it falls back to asking
the CLI itself via :func:`omnigent.onboarding.harness_install.harness_cli_logged_in`,
which runs ``agy models`` (exit 0 only when signed in) and so reads the credential
wherever agy stored it, Keychain or system keyring included.

The fallback asks the CLI rather than inspecting
``~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`` because omnigent's own CLI launch
path creates that file under the real home before agy ever starts
(:func:`omnigent.harnesses.antigravity_native.bridge.ensure_agy_feedback_survey_disabled`).
Its presence proves only that omnigent ran, not that anyone signed in, so
keying on it would leave the credential gate permanently satisfied. Nothing
omnigent writes can make ``agy models`` exit 0.

Like :func:`omnigent.onboarding.ambient.codex_auth_has_credential` and
:func:`omnigent.onboarding.ambient.claude_auth_has_credential`, the file check
cannot detect server-side revocation — its job is to reject the "no-credential /
file-empty / file-corrupt" cases. On the rare machine carrying *both* files —
e.g. a home directory migrated across OSes — a stale token could read as
logged-in; that is benign (agy re-drives OAuth on launch) and ``agy models``
remains the authoritative check.

This module feeds a readiness path that must never raise, so every probe turns
failure — an unreadable home, a missing ``agy`` binary, a hung or non-zero
``agy models`` — into ``False``.
